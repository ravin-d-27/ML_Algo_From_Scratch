# ML Algorithms from Scratch
`This repository contains most of the famous ML Algorithms from scratch and works as same as the Scikit-learn Library's ML Models`
`Please find the documenation of the implemented models down below`

<h1>List of Machine Learning Models implemented</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href = "https://github.com/ravin-d-27/ML_Algo_From_Scratch/blob/main/Supervised_Models/KNN_Implementation/KNN_Documentation.md">K-Nearest Neighbour</a>
        <p>KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm based on finding similar data points. In this repository, it perfectly works for Classification Tasks</p>

        <a href = "https://github.com/ravin-d-27/ML_Algo_From_Scratch/blob/main/Supervised_Models/Linear_Regression_Implementation/Linear_Regression_Documentation.md">Linear Regression</a>
        <p>Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, meaning that a change in the independent variable(s) is associated with a proportional change in the dependent variable.</p>

        <a href = "https://github.com/ravin-d-27/ML_Algo_From_Scratch/blob/main/Supervised_Models/Logistic_Regression_Implementation/Logistic_Regression_Documenation.md">Logistic Regression</a>
        <p>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that can be used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable.</p>

        <a href = "https://github.com/ravin-d-27/ML_Algo_From_Scratch/blob/main/Supervised_Models/Logistic_Regression_Implementation/Naive_Bayes_Documentation.md">Naive Bayes Algorithm</a>
        <p>Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.</p>
