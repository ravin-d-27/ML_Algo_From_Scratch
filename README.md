# ML Algorithms from Scratch
`This repository contains most of the famous ML Algorithms from scratch and works as same as the Scikit-learn Library's ML Models`
`Please find the documenation of the implemented models down below`

<h1>List of Machine Learning Models implemented</h1>

        <a href = "https://github.com/ravin-d-27/ML_Algo_From_Scratch/blob/main/Unsupervised_Models/KNN_Implementation/KNN_Documentation.md">K-Nearest Neighbour</a>
        <p>KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm based on finding similar data points. In this repository, it perfectly works for Classification Tasks</p>
